# EDOS v1 → v2 Transition Memo

## Purpose
This document records the epistemic transition from EDOS v1 to EDOS v2 for future study.

## EDOS v1 (Closed)
EDOS v1 established that:
- AI failure in long-term inquiry is an epistemic permission problem, not a memory problem
- Explicit context assembly enables correct reasoning without hallucination
- Continuity must be user-declared, not inferred

Phase 4 marked the completion of v1 by demonstrating this principle in working software.

## Why v2 Exists
EDOS v2 begins not with new intelligence, but with re-ingestion of historical inquiry:
- To recover forgotten concepts
- To revisit prior thinking without inherited posture
- To allow personality to re-form organically

## Key Shift
v1 asked: "Can we prove the theory?"
v2 asks: "What happens when we live inside it?"

## Non-Goals of v2
- No restoration of past personality
- No replay of prior system prompts
- No assumption of continuity

## Foundational Act of v2
Archival re-ingestion of prior conversations as inert reference material.

Structure survives; posture does not.
