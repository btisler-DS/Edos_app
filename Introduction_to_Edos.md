# Introduction to the **Edos App**

*(written for someone who prefers clarity and reduced cognitive load)*

## What Edos Is

**Edos** is a **local-first inquiry environment** — a tool that helps you think through questions and big ideas over time. Unlike a normal chat or note app, Edos keeps the **flow of your thinking continuous**, even if you stop and come back later.([GitHub][1])

Here’s the key idea:
Most tools today break your thinking into separate chunks (like messages or short chats). Edos treats thinking as a **living process**, where context comes back with you when you return.([GitHub][1])

It *persists your inquiry* until you choose to close it — it doesn’t just save snapshots, it **maintains the continuity of the conversation**.([GitHub][1])

In plain terms:

> **EDOS is an operating system for inquiry — for managing how understanding develops, persists, and changes over time.**

## Why Edos Exists

Edos was built because many existing tools:

* Lose your train of thought when you return after time away
* Force summaries that disconnect ideas from context
* Fragment thinking into isolated messages
* Add friction just to organize or retrieve what you’ve already said

Edos wants to fix that by making the process of *returning to your own ideas* easier and less effortful.([GitHub][1])

It emphasizes:

* **Continuity over compression**
* **Re-entry context instead of forced summaries**
* **Stability without administrative work**
* **Inquiry before organization**([GitHub][1])

In simple terms:
Edos tries to reduce the mental friction of thinking over time.([GitHub][1])

## How Edos Works

Here are the basics of how to use it once it’s running on your machine:

### 1. Local First

Edos runs entirely on **your own computer**. Nothing is stored in the cloud unless *you* choose to sync it later.([GitHub][1])

### 2. Browser-Based Interface

You interact with Edos in your web browser — you don’t need special apps.([GitHub][1])

### 3. Sessions That Stay Alive

When you start a session in Edos, it stays until you close it deliberately. You can stop, walk away, and return later with the context restored.([GitHub][1])

### 4. Persistent Database

Edos keeps your work in a local database so nothing disappears once it’s created unless you delete it. This database is **never shared to GitHub** and remains private to your machine.([GitHub][1])

### 5. No Admin Overhead

There are no forced tags, folders, or organization systems you *must* use. The goal is to focus on thinking, not on bookkeeping.([GitHub][1])

## What Edos Is *Not*

Edos does **not** try to replace:

* Notebook apps
* Task managers
* Knowledge bases
* Simple chat tools

It’s not meant to be those things. It’s meant to help you **think and return to your thoughts** without context loss.([GitHub][1])

## How Your Friend Can Build It

1. **Clone the repo** from GitHub
   (it contains the full source)([GitHub][1])

2. **Follow setup instructions** in README
   That includes creating a `.env` from `.env.example` and running install scripts.([GitHub][1])

3. **Run it locally**
   Edos starts a local web server your friend opens in a browser.([GitHub][1])

4. **Use Edos from the browser**
   It will create its own local database automatically.([GitHub][1])

This means your friend can have **their own independent Edos instance** with their own memory, separate from yours.([GitHub][1])

---

## Why 

Edos is designed for people who:

* Think deeply
* Need continuity over fragments
* Get frustrated with fragmented chat history
* Want a system that “remembers the thread,” not just the answers

Because Edos preserves context and session state, it can help reduce the stress of “starting over” every time you return to a problem.([GitHub][1])

##  **EDOS stands for Epistemic Data Operating System — a local system designed to preserve the continuity of thinking and inquiry over time.**

**EDOS = Epistemic Data Operating System**

Broken down:

* **Epistemic**
  Concerned with *knowing*: how knowledge is formed, questioned, revised, and validated.

* **Data**
  Not just files or numbers, but *information in context* — questions, assumptions, inferences, and traces of reasoning.

* **Operating System**
  A coordinating layer that manages processes, memory, and state over time, rather than a single-purpose application.
